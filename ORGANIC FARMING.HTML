    <p>
      Organic farming, also known as organic agriculture or ecological
      farming or biological farming,is an agricultural system 
      that emphasizes the use of naturally occurring, non-synthetic inputs, such as
      compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such 
      as crop rotation, companion planting, and mixed cropping. Biological pest control methods
      such as the fostering of insect predators are also encouraged. Organic agriculture
      can be defined as "an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the 
      enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity while, with rare exceptions,
      prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilizers, genetically 
      modified organisms, and growth hormones". It originated early in the
      20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Certified organic 
      agriculture accounted for 70 million hectares (170 million acres) globally in 2019,
      with over half of that total in Australia </p>
      <P>Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally occurring substances while prohibiting or severely limiting synthetic substances. For instance, naturally occurring pesticides, such as garlic extract, bicarbonate of soda, or pyrethrin (which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower), are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, such as glyphosate, are prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed only in exceptional circumstances may include copper sulfate, elemental sulfur, and veterinary drugs. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited. Broadly, organic agriculture is based on the principles of health, care for all living beings and the environment, ecology, and fairness. Organic methods champion sustainability, self-sufficiency, autonomy and independence, health, animal welfare, food security, and 
        food safety. It is often seen as part of the solution to the impacts of climate change.</P>
      <P>Organic agricultural methods are internationally regulated and legally enforced by transnational organizations such as the European Union and also by individual nations, based in large part on the standards set by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), an international umbrella organization for organic farming organizations established in 1972, with regional branches such as IFOAM Organics Europe and IFOAM Asia. Since 1990, the market for organic food and other products has grown rapidly, reaching $150 billion worldwide in 2022 – of which more than $64 billion was earned in North America and EUR 53 billion in Europe. This demand has driven a similar increase in organically managed farmland, which grew by 26.6 percent from 2021 to 2022. As of 2022, organic farming is practiced in 188 countries and approximately 96,000,000 hectares (240,000,000 acres) worldwide were farmed organically 
        by 4.5 million farmers, representing approximately 2 percent of total world farmland</P>
        <H1 style="color: blueviolet;">HISTORY</H1>
      <P>Agriculture was practiced for thousands of years without the use of artificial chemicals. Artificial fertilizers were first developed during the mid-19th century. These early fertilizers were cheap, powerful, and easy to transport in bulk. Similar advances occurred in chemical pesticides in the 1940s, leading to the decade being referred to as the "pesticide era".These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the short-term, had serious longer-term side-effects, such as soil compaction, erosion, and declines in overall soil fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply.[27]: 10  In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soil biology scientists began to seek ways 
          to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production.</P>
      <P>In 1921 the founder and pioneer of the organic movement, Albert Howard, 
         and his wife Gabrielle Howard accomplished botanists, founded an 
         Institute of Plant Industry to improve traditional farming methods in India.
         Among other things, they brought improved implements and improved animal 
         husbandry methods from their scientific training; then by incorporating aspects 
         of Indian traditional methods, developed protocols for the rotation of crops, 
         erosion prevention techniques, and the systematic use of composts and manures.Stimulated 
         by these experiences of traditional farming, when Albert Howard returned to Britain in the
         early 1930s[32] he began to promulgate a system of organic agriculture.
      In 1924 Rudolf Steiner gave a series of eight lectures on agriculture with a focus on 
      influences of the moon, planets, non-physical beings and elemental forces.They were held
       in response to a request by adherent farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a
        deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use 
        of chemical fertilizers. The lectures were published in November 1924; the first 
        English translation appeared in 1928 as The Agriculture Course</P>
        <P>In July 1939, Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, the author of the standard work on biodynamic agriculture (Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening), came to the UK at the invitation of Walter James, 4th Baron Northbourne as a presenter at the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference on Biodynamic Farming at Northbourne's farm in Kent. One of the chief purposes of the conference was to bring together the proponents of various approaches to organic agriculture in order that they might cooperate within a larger movement. Howard attended the conference, where he met Pfeiffer. In the following year, Northbourne published his manifesto of organic farming, Look to the Land, in which he coined the term "organic farming". The Betteshanger conference has been described as the 
          'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and other forms of organic farming</P>
        <P>In 1940, Howard published his An Agricultural Testament. In this book he adopted Northbourne's terminology of "organic farming". Howard's work spread widely, and he became known as the "father of organic farming" for his work in applying scientific knowledge and principles to various traditional and natural methods.[27]: 45  In the United States J. I. Rodale, who was keenly interested both in Howard's ideas and in biodynamics, founded in the 1940s both a working organic farm for trials and experimentation, The Rodale Institute, and Rodale, Inc., in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, to teach and advocate organic methods to the wider public. These became important influences on the spread of organic agriculture. Further work was done by Lady Eve Balfour (the Haughley Experiment) 
          in the United Kingdom, and many other places across the world.
           The term "eco-agriculture" was coined in 1970 by Charles Walters, founder of Acres Magazine, to describe agriculture which does not use "man-made molecules of 
           toxic rescue chemistry", effectively another name for organic agriculture</P>
